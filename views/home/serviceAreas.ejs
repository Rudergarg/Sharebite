<div class="bg-white m-4 p-4 shadow">
  <p>We’re proud to serve communities across India and are continuously expanding our reach to ensure that no meal goes to waste. Our dedicated volunteers, agents, and partner organizations work tirelessly in every city we operate in to collect, preserve, and distribute food responsibly.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Delhi NCR</h4>
  <p>Our journey began in Delhi NCR — the heart of our mission. Here, we partner with NGOs, community kitchens, and local shelters to deliver thousands of meals daily to those in need.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Mumbai</h4>
  <p>In the city that never sleeps, our volunteers and restaurant partners ensure that surplus food from events, hotels, and homes reaches underprivileged families safely and on time.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Bengaluru</h4>
  <p>Bengaluru’s eco-conscious spirit aligns with our mission of reducing food waste. We work with tech parks, canteens, and social groups to collect and redistribute fresh, edible food.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Hyderabad</h4>
  <p>From residential areas to bustling markets, our Hyderabad team ensures that no good food is thrown away. Daily collections help support local orphanages and old-age homes.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Jaipur</h4>
  <p>In the Pink City, we collaborate with temples, hostels, and charitable trusts to create a strong community network that supports hunger relief and food sustainability.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Chandigarh</h4>
  <p>Known for its organization and cleanliness, Chandigarh has become a model city for efficient food redistribution through our trained volunteers and dedicated collection agents.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Coming Soon</h4>
  <p>We’re thrilled to announce that we’re expanding our services to <strong>Lucknow, Pune, and Kolkata</strong> soon! Our goal is to reach every corner of India, building a network of compassion where every plate of food finds the right person, at the right time.</p>
